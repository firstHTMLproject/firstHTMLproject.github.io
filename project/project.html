    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <details>
        <summary>My Childhood</summary>
        <p>I was born and grew up in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I lived with my family. Even though I had travelled a lot when I was younger, I thought the best place in the world is your home. And I still think so.</p>
